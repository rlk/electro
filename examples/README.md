# Electro Examples


- data

    The data directory contains objects, textures, and materials used by multiple Electro apps.

- asteroids

    Asteroids is an example of a full-fledged game implemented in Electro using objects, textures, sounds, collision, and high scores storage.

    Press Space to start the game and fire the gun. Arrows turn and boost the ship. The joystick is also supported.

- driving

    The driving example uses the full rigid body dynamics system to define a drivable vehicle.

    The arrow keys and joystick control the car. '1' spaws a box. '2' spawns a ball. '3' spawns a car. '4' flips the car onto its wheels in case it rolls onto its roof.

- fifteen

    The Fifteen Puzzle is the example described in the Electro tutorial documentation. Arrow keys slide the tiles.

- shader

    The shader example demonstrates per-pixel lighting using GLSL.

- viewobj

    ViewOBJ is a generic OBJ model viewer application. ViewOBJ loads all OBJ files listed on the command line.

    Left-mouse-drag tumbles the object. Right-mouse-drag scales the object. The joystick and arrow keys navigate the virtual world. The insert and delete keys toggle object auto-spin.

- vortex

    Total Perspective Vortex demonstrates an interactive galaxy fly-through.

    Mouse motion pans the view. Right-mouse-drag moves the view forward and back. Middle-mouse-drag changes the star magnitude. Space bar halts the view motion and Return resets the view to the center.
