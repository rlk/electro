# Electro Configurations

- HD.lua

    This script configures rendering to a full-screen 1920x1080 window.

- 3DTV-LR.lua

    This script configures stereoscopic rendering on a 1080P 3D TV in left-right mode.

- cube.lua

    This script opens a single 1600x1200 window with 6 square viewports. The 6 views look down the 6 axes, and together the 6 view frustums fill the unit cube. Using this configuration, a cube map of any scene may be generated simply by taking a screenshot.

- quad-stereo.lua

    This script configures a default 800x600 window with quad-buffered stereo enabled. This appropriate for use on an NVIDIA Quadro with CrystalEyes stereo glasses.

- test.lua

    This script configures 4 small tiles in a single 800x600 window. This is useful for local viewport and view-culling testing.

- localhost.lua

    This script configures 4 hosts, each with an 800x600 window. This is useful for parallel rendering testing.
